;;; find-files.el --- Get a list of files in the current directory

;;; Commentary:

;;  Makes sure the file is not already linked to a buffer.

;;; Code:

(defun ff/find-files (extension)
"Use EXTENSION to find other files that could have a function definition."
  (let (list index)
    (dolist (element (directory-files "." nil nil t) list)
      (if (and (not (eq (setq index (search "." element)) nil))
               (string= (substring element (1+ index)) extension)
               (not (ff/buffer-exists element))
               (file-readable-p element))
          (setq list (cons element list))))))

(defun ff/buffer-exists (file)
"Return nil if buffer for FILE does not exist."
  (if (get-buffer file)
      t))
